It is too early to say whether this indicates a change to the overall trend or simply a pause, which has happened before. The exceptions to this stable picture are rises in some types of theft and in lower-volume but higher harm types of violence, and a fall in the high-volume offence of computer misuse. ","headline2":"As these figures cover a broad range of crime types and there is variation in the trends by crime type, it is better to consider the different types individually to understand these changes. ","headline3":"","unit":"","preUnit":"","source":""},"topics":[],"searchBoost":[],"_type":"bulletin"},{"uri":"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2017","type":"bulletin","description":{"title":"Crime in England and Wales","summary":"Crime against households and adults, also including data on crime experienced by children, and crimes against businesses and society.","keywords":["police","criminal activity","victims","offences","personal experience"],"metaDescription":"Crime against households and adults, also including data on crime experienced by children, and crimes against businesses and society.","nationalStatistic":true,"contact":{"email":"crimestatistics@ons.gsi.gov.uk","name":"John Flatley","telephone":"+44 (0)20 7592 8695"},"releaseDate":"2018-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","nextRelease":" 26 April 2018","edition":"year ending September 2017","headline1":"Our assessment of the main data sources is that levels of crime have continued to fall consistent with the general trend since the mid-1990s.

It also shows that crime is not a common experience for most people, with 8 in 10 adults surveyed by the CSEW not being a victim of any of the crimes asked about in the survey. ","headline3":"Other data sources including police data on the number of crimes recorded, show evidence of increases in some of the less frequently occurring, but higher-harm offences.

Next quarter (in January 2017) it is our intention to add these estimates to the headline CSEW totals, once the questions have been asked for a full 12 months in the survey.
